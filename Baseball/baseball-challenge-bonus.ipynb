One that's been quite visible when watching the game in the past few years is the [infield shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_shift). The gist of the strategy is to position the infielders in areas of the diamond that will increase their chances of making an out. This is done for each batter, and starts with looking at the batter's hitting tendencies over a certain timeframe (i.e. career, season, month) and placing the infielders where the ball is most likely to get hit. MLB uses specific criteria to define each type of shift, but details can be found [here](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/statcast/shifts).\n",

    "Starting in the 2023 season, MLB and the MLB Player's Association have agreed to add new rules that effectively ban infield shifting. As we can see from the pie chart above, shifting was only implemented a little less than half the time a batter came to the plate. Is it an effective strategy, or is the change in rules going to have a minimal impact on the game?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can investigate that by looking at how many outs were made with shifting, versus those that were made without shifting. First, we have to look at plays only made by infielders. Thankfully, the data has a field that allows us to do that: `hit_location`. Values in this field are numbers that represent the *position* of the first defensive player to touch the ball, according to a numbering convention in baseball:\n",
