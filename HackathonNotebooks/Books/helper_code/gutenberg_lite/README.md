## Note

This is a frozen version of the [c-w/gutenberg](https://github.com/c-w/gutenberg) project with a few of the
dependencies to BerkeleyDB removed to make it easier to use basic functionality for downloading Gutenberg
texts and cleaning them when it's difficult to install the BerkeleyDB dependencies on a server.
