It's not hard to imagine that there are many similarities and differences between people and nations from across the globe with respect to cultural, environmental, political, or economic systems. One way to get to know and engage our global neighbours better is through data. In this hackathon notebook you will play with some global datasets that will hopefully encourage you to become a better global citizen. Happy hacking!"
