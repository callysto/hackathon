    "[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) is a free library for Python that makes loading and manipulating data more straightforward by using something called a **dataframe**. Think of a dataframe as like a spreadsheet, but better.\n",

    "### Loading Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are reading a `csv` (comma separated values) file of the data set using the pandas command `read_csv`. The argument we pass to `read_csv` is the file name and location (either a file a local file or one on the internet)."

    "\n",
    "But first, let's go over what each column means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `angle` : the angle at which a turn will be taken, if the `direction` is a turn (number or `NaN`, which means not a number).\n",
    "2. `direction` : The direction (forward or backward, or left or right turn) the turtle will move (number or `NaN`).\n",
    "3. `length` : The distance (in pixels) the turtle should move forward or backward, if `direction` is forward/backward (number or `NaN`).\n",
    "4. `order` : The order in which commands should be run to draw a given shape (number, counting starts at 0).\n",
    "5. `shape` : The shape the row is associated with (string).\n",
