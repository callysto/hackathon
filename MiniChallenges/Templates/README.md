# Mini-Challenge Notebook Templates

This folder, and the files within, are designed to be somewhat template-like so that they can be easily adapted into any theme to create new challenges. These challenges are also less difficult than the hackathon notebooks contained in `HackathonNotebooks`, designed for younger students (i.e. late elementary or junior high). They're based off the *CuriosityTrack* notebooks from [SustainabilityOnMars](https://github.com/callysto/hackathon/tree/master/SustainabilityOnMars/CuriosityTrack).

The goal is to fit a theme into the 7-part notebook challenge series where the same concepts are taught in each challenge regardless of topic. The end result is a set of notebooks that are easier to judge and have uniform outcomes.

Required to implement a new theme:

1. Data (named `data.csv`) in same folder as `interactive.py`
    - The last (`[-1]`) column should be some form of numerical data for math operations

1. Design changes to all the slides
    - Feel free to modify the images in the `images` folder

1. Though the `interactive.py` file is designed to be fairly universal, it will still require some modification to make it fit each theme.
