    "Plastics are useful for generating fibers (textiles, rope), sheets (bags, wraps, windows), and 3D structures. On Earth, one million plastic drinking bottles are purchased every minute, and up to 5 trillion single-use plastic bags are used worldwide every year. In total, half of all plastic produced is designed to be used only once — and then thrown away (source: UN Environment). \n",

We will also explore the extent of plastic waste coming from lollipops 🍭🍭🍭. "
