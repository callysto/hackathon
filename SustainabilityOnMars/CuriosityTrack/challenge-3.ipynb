    "For instance, if we wanted to select all entries in a dataset's column with a value above 5, we could do `dataset[\"column_name\"] >= 5`. This will give us all of the matching data entries whose value in the column is greater or equal to 5. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Logical Operators**: To use more than one, we need to use logical operators. For example, `&` means and, `|` (vertical bar) means or, and `~` means not. Therefore, we can do something like: `dataset[\"column_name\"] >= 5 & dataset[\"column_name\"] < 10` or even: `dataset[\"column_name\"] >= 5 | dataset[\"column_name\"] < 2 `. \n",
