# Toronto Open Data

Your challenge is to explore the [City of Toronto's Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca) to find an interesting dataset, create some visualizations, and communicate what you find. You can create and submit a new Jupyter notebook, or just a document.

## Suggested Goals:

1. What data types are in the dataset?
1. Why is this dataset interesting to you?
1. What visualizations can you create from the dataset?
1. What is important to communicate about this dataset?
1. Are there missing values in the dataset? Why, do you think?
1. Why do you think this dataset is published?
1. What could this dataset be used for?
1. How do you think Toronto compares to other Canadian cities that have similar datasets available?
1. Are there any interesting or strange patterns in the dataset?
1. What is the range and distribution of the variables in the dataset?
1. Are there any significant outliers in the dataset?

## Hackathon Reflections

Write about some or all of the following questions:

- What is something you learned through this process?
- How well did your group work together? Why do you think that is?
- What were some of the hardest parts?
- What are you proud of? What would you like to show others?
- Are you curious about anything else related to this? Did anything surprise you?
- How can you apply your learning to future activities?
