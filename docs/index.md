# Callysto Data Science Student Hackathons

Callysto runs free data science hackathons for Grades 5-12 classrooms in Canada. During our hackathons, students solve a problem by “hacking” or analyzing open datasets. We offer both online and in-person hackathons.

* Students work independently (or in groups) on their hackathon challenges.
* Students attend virtual support sessions, led by Callysto experts, as needed.
* Students submit their challenges to the Callysto team for judging.
