# Callysto Data Science Student Hackathons

Callysto runs free data science hackathons for Grades 5-12 classrooms in Canada. During our hackathons, students solve a problem by “hacking” or analyzing open datasets. We offer both online and in-person hackathons.

## Online Hackathons

* Students need a secure internet connection to participate.
* The hackathons typically run for 2-3 days, but may be longer.
* Students attend a virtual launch event, led by Callysto experts, to get an overview of the hackathon challenges and ask questions.
* Students work independently (or in groups) on their hackathon challenges.
* Students attend virtual support sessions, led by Callysto experts, as needed.
* Students submit their challenges to the Callysto team for judging.
* Callysto announces the hackathon winner(s).

## Hackathon Offerings

* School or classroom hackathons
  * If you're an educator in Canada, you or your school district can ask us to lead a hackathon. We handle the event from start-to-finish.
* Hackathon material creation
  * if you're an educator in Canada and need help making hackathon materials, we can support you. We also have a [hackathon planning guide](https://bit.ly/34yU5un) to help you get started.
