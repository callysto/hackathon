# JupyterLite Callysto Challenges 

Callysto is a free, online learning tool that helps Grades 5-12 students and teachers learn and apply in-demand data science skills including data analysis and visualization, coding, and computational thinking. Our mission is to foster computational thinking and data literacy skills in Canadian schools.


## Data Labyrinths
In a data labyrinth, students work with a dataset centered around a specific topic or idea. Throughout the labyrinth, they tackle tasks that vary in difficulty, progressing from easy to challenging using the provided data.
